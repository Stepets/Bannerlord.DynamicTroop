# Bannerlord.DynamicTroop

## Description

Embark on a more immersive and strategic journey in Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord with the Dynamic Troop Equipment System mod. This innovative modification changes the way your troops equip for battle, making every victory more rewarding and every decision more impactful.

### **Key Features:**

1. **Integrated Armoury:** Troops now have access to a dynamic army armoury. By defeating or incapacitating enemy soldiers (except hero units), a complete set of the fallen enemy's equipment will be added to your armoury upon victory.
  
2. **Realistic equipment upgrades:** Troops no longer magically receive new equipment when they level up. Instead, they will select appropriate equipment from their armoury.
  
3. **Strategic Equipment Selection:** Soldiers will prioritise equipment based on their level and the value of the item. Weapon selection is limited to the types traditionally wielded by their respective unit types (e.g. one-handed staffs, two-handed swords, throwing axes). If no suitable weapons are available, a random melee weapon will be selected.
  
4. **Equipment Recovery:** Even if your troops are killed in battle, their equipment can be recovered if you emerge victorious.
  
5. **Standard Loot System Unaffected:** You'll still receive loot according to the original game mechanics, which can be considered loot from the enemy armoury.
  
6. **Player-centric equipment system:** This dynamic equipment system will only affect player troops and will not affect NPC units, including family NPCs.
  
7. **New recruit equipment:** When you recruit new soldiers, their starter equipment is automatically added to your armoury (including multiple sets if available).
  
8. **Armory Management:** Access and manage your armory from the town menus. Note: Crafting equipment may be subject to bugs.

### **More information:**

9. **Compatibility:** The mod is compatible with other mods that do not introduce new equipment types.
  
10. **Open Source:** Access the mod's source code on GitHub: [GitHub repository link](https://github.com/tategotoazarasi/Bannerlord.DynamicTroop).
  
11. **Recommended Launcher:** Use the BUTR launcher for optimal performance.

## **Future update plans for the Dynamic Troop Equipment System Mod**.

### 1. Bug fixes:**.

- Continued efforts to identify and fix existing bugs in the mod for a smoother gameplay experience.

### 2. Detailed Loot Acquisition Improvements:**.

- Horses and horse armour that are killed or flee in battle are no longer recoverable.
- Broken shields will no longer be collected.
- Armour that takes a fatal or critical hit may not be salvageable.
- Realistic arrow and bullet usage in combat.
- When recruiting mercenaries, their equipment will be available (or they will always use their own equipment).
- When recruiting, only one set of armour is added at first, then identical types of equipment from different sets are combined in the armoury.

### 3. Detailed improvements to soldier equipment selection:**.

- Allocation of surplus shields to unshielded troops with one-handed weapons and available equipment slots.
- Allocation of surplus throwing weapons to melee troops with available slots.
- Allocate surplus arrows to ranged units with available slots.
- Equip troops with available slots and no two-handed/poly-armed weapons from the surplus of such weapons.
- Prioritise cavalry for weapons suitable for lance charges.
- Give more consideration to the original equipment characteristics of soldiers, such as bonuses against shields or spear bracing capabilities.

### Long term goals:**.

- Extend the functionality of the mod to all NPC troops, fully integrating the dynamic equipment system throughout the game.
